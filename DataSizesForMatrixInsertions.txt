Using arrays of 1 and 0:
TOTAL SIZE
22.1KB
AVG. SIZE
7.4KB
RESULT: Bad.

Using arrays of booleans:
TOTAL SIZE
13.8KB
AVG. SIZE
4.6KB
RESULT: Better. Almost 50% less data to store than original method.

Using Uint8 arrays of 1 and 0:
TOTAL SIZE
22.1KB
AVG. SIZE
7.4KB
RESULT: Bad. Same as original.

Using buffer to convert to hex:
TOTAL SIZE
1.3KB
AVG. SIZE
446B
RESULT: Really good, but see NOTE. Almost 95% less data to store than original method. 
NOTE: There appears to be some data loss. Not sure if that's from conversion or processing matrix.

Using buffer to covert to base64:
TOTAL SIZE
1.3KB
AVG. SIZE
441B
RESULT: Really good, but see NOTE.
NOTE: There appears to be some data loss. Not sure if that's from conversion or processing matrix.

Full binary:
TOTAL SIZE
1.3KB
AVG. SIZE
435B
Result: This is the best that I'm going to be able to get without making the matrix array itself
into binary.
NOTE: MongoDB always displays binary data in base64.

Parsing JSON to binary:
TOTAL SIZE
6.2KB
AVG. SIZE
2.1KB
Result: About 75% of the original size, yet likely more useable than small types.
